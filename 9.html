The deal appeared to satisfy the oil market and most of the cartel’s members, but strained the group’s unity and set up testing times ahead.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, de facto leader of the group alongside his Russian counterpart, was frank that the deal was hard-won.“It’s very excruciating, it’s very tiring,” Prince Abdulaziz told reporters after the meeting on Thursday. “If you want to work with 23 countries, you have to be very congenial to the idea of flexibility.”For all his talk of fatigue, the prince had just signed up to an even more grueling schedule of meetings between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, which will define the trajectory of crude prices for months to come.After a split emerged between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the cartel couldn’t agree on what had been widely expected before this week: a full three-month delay to the scheduled January output increase. Instead ministers resolved to add 500,000 barrels a day of production to the market next month, then hold monthly meetings to decide on subsequent moves.The accord could add a maximum of 2 million barrels a day to the market, but ministers could equally decide to cut production again if needed, said Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak. The maximum change in any month will be 500,000 barrels a day in either direction.After this week’s drawn-out negotiations, it’s not “the nightmare scenario that the market feared, but it is not what it really expected weeks ago,” said Rystad Energy AS senior analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu. “The fact that February’s production levels are still under discussion puts more uncertainty ahead for the coming OPEC+ meetings.”Responding to UncertaintyThe revised deal is not as conclusive as many OPEC-watchers had expected, but it could be a rational response to the tremendous uncertainty in energy markets.OPEC+ is only just emerging from a period of historic turbulence. It rescued the oil market earlier this year from an unprecedented slump, slashing production by 9.7 million barrels a day as the pandemic crushed demand.The cartel returned 2 million barrels a day of that output to the market in August without a hiccup, and was due to add a similar volume next month. Yet several members of the group were worried that the market was still too fragile to absorb those extra barrels.While a breakthrough in vaccines to tackle the coronavirus spurred a rally in oil prices, a resurgence in infections has triggered a new wave of lockdowns and inflicted a fresh blow to fuel consumption. The cartel and the wider industry have downgraded their outlooks for 2021, with a picture that’s sharply polarized between recovery in Asia and stagnation in Europe.The January output increase, which is just a quarter of what would have occurred under the previous OPEC+ deal, is likely to keep the oil market in deficit throughout the first quarter, according to Bloomberg calculations using OPEC data. That means bloated fuel inventories that weigh on prices will continue to drain.“This 0.5 million barrels a day absolutely will be absorbed in the market very easily,” Amrita Sen, co-founder of consultant Energy Aspects Ltd., said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday. “This really does make sure that the market will not be in oversupply in the first quarter.”Brent crude jumped 2.1% to $49.72 as of 8:07 a.m. in London, a nine-month high.If the group had gone ahead with the full supply hike, the cartel’s economists had calculated that the market would have flipped into surplus, potentially undermining the recent price rally.“It’s a wise decision,” Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh told state run news service Shana after the talks concluded. “These monthly meetings can help preserve stability in the market” and the additional supplies coming in January won’t have a big impact, he said.Difficult ProcessThe flexibility afforded by a monthly cycle of high-stakes ministerial meetings may be desirable, but the process of getting there appears to be less so.“There was a lot of drama in this meeting, and tensions flying high,” said Sen.The intensity of a fight earlier this week between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates took OPEC-watchers by surprise. The pair have long been staunch allies, but Abu Dhabi is pursuing a more independent oil policy. It’s investing heavily in new production capacity, wants to pump more oil and believes its current quota is unfair. It even signaled last month it was considering its options outside the club.On Monday, differences between the two countries prevented the cartel from reaching a clear agreement, forcing them to delay the scheduled meeting with OPEC+ allies by two days.In an apparent gesture of frustration, the Saudi energy minister told the group that he may resign as co-chair. His UAE counterpart Suhail Al Mazrouei was offered the post, but refused, according to a person familiar with the situation. In the end, OPEC+ asked Prince Abdulaziz to stay put.In his closing remarks after Thursday’s meeting, the prince chose to highlight the episode. “It’s sometimes very frustrating, and that’s why two to three days ago I threw in the towel,” he said. “But the towel comes back to me.”Several analysts predicted more trouble ahead in 2021.“Saudi-UAE relations continue to bear watching,” said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc. “The UAE is likely to be more independent and influential in group affairs going forward.”(Updates with analyst comment in 13th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p> Business Bloomberg <h3> Stocks Hold Gains Ahead of Key Data; Oil Climbs: Markets Wrap </h3> <p> (Bloomberg) -- Stocks edged higher on Friday as investors mulled the recent strength in global equities while awaiting key data on the U.S. labor market. Oil extended gains from a nine-month high after an OPEC+ deal.The Stoxx Europe 600 index posted a modest gain at the open, led by energy shares. S&amp;P 500 futures ticked higher. Most Asian benchmarks rose, with South Korea and Taiwan outperforming. The dollar headed for its biggest weekly decline in five, while Treasury yields nudged higher.Data later Friday is expected to show U.S. employment gains probably slowed only modestly in November despite a record surge of coronavirus cases.Global equities remain around record highs as investors bet positive vaccine developments can help sustain an economic recovery next year. Uncertainty remains about a U.S. stimulus package, where a bipartisan proposal endorsed by Democratic leaders as a basis for negotiations is luring increased interest from Republicans, lifting the chances for a deal by year-end.“If we do see earnings growth start to pickup, perhaps 25% to 30% on the S&amp;P 500 next year, and if we see rates remain low and stimulus in place, that remains a good backdrop for risk assets,” Mona Mahajan, investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said on Bloomberg TV.Oil climbed as OPEC+ reached an agreement to ease its output cuts next year more gradually than previously planned. The Pentagon added four more Chinese companies -- including China National Offshore Oil Corp. -- to a list of firms it says are owned or controlled by the country’s military, exposing them to increased scrutiny and potential sanctions by the U.S.These are some key events coming up:The U.S. employment report on Friday is expected to show more Americans headed back to work in November, though at a slower pace than October.German factory orders for October are due Friday.Here are the main moves in markets:StocksThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.3% by 8:15 a.m. in London.Futures on the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.3%.The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.5%.The MSCI Emerging Market Index rose 0.9%.CurrenciesThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell 0.1%.The euro bought $1.2162, up 0.2%.The British pound gained 0.1% to $1.3461.The yen weakened 0.1% to 103.97 per dollar.BondsThe yield on 10-year Treasuries climbed one basis point to 0.92%.Germany’s 10-year yield was little changed at -0.56%.The U.K.’s 10-year yield was little changed at 0.32%.CommoditiesWest Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.8% to $46.48 a barrel.Gold held at around $1,841 an ounce.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p> News The Canadian Press <h3> German factory orders up again in October, beat forecasts </h3> <p> BERLIN — Factory orders in Germany, Europe&#x27;s biggest economy, rose for the sixth consecutive month in October and exceeded economists&#x27; expectations, official data released Friday showed.Orders were up 2.9% compared with the previous month, the Economy Ministry said. That compared with economists&#x27; forecast of 1.5 %. It followed gains of 4.9% in August and 1.1% in September.Demand for investment goods such as factory machinery led the gains in October, while orders for consumer goods were down. Orders from both domestic and foreign customers were up, though those from elsewhere in the 19-nation eurozone were up a relatively feeble 0.5%.Sharp rises in coronavirus infections led to partial shutdowns in Germany and elsewhere in Europe in November.In Germany, restaurants, bars, sports and leisure facilities have been closed since Nov. 2, while schools and nonessential shops have remained open. Those measures, which are milder than those taken in the first phase of the pandemic, are expected to remain in place until at least Jan. 10.The Associated Press</p> Business Bloomberg <h3> Wall Street Keeps Pushing Into China as Washington Balks </h3> <p> (Bloomberg) -- A year into China’s big bang opening of its financial markets, Wall Street has ever more to lose from a growing consensus in Washington over reining in Beijing.It’s a risk they’re willing to take.A star-studded cast of global banks and fund houses have increased their presence in China this year and a record $212 billion of foreign funds have poured into Chinese bonds and stocks. Alongside have come a myriad of measures from Washington aimed at decoupling the U.S. from China, an issue that’s drawn bipartisan support given widespread alarm about the Asian nation’s rising influence in global affairs.The latest U.S. salvo was fired on Wednesday with the passage of legislation that could lead to Chinese companies -- including behemoths like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- getting kicked off American exchanges. The turbulence hasn’t swayed global finance from the opportunity to capture a share of profits that are estimated to swell to $47 billion in investment banking alone by 2026.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. are now pushing to take full control of their China ventures, while fund giants such as BlackRock Inc have been given the greenlight to set up shop.“There’s a lot of risk and uncertainty about future policy directions” said Chen Zhiwu, director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong. “But on the other hand, wow, the market is so big so some people are still willing to go in for the potential high gain at the cost of being exposed to a lot of high risk.”All signs point to Congress continuing the confrontation under President-elect Joe Biden’s administration, with the risk of the finance industry becoming deeper enmeshed. Biden’s pick for national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has questioned why the U.S. should prioritize opening China for the likes of Goldman Sachs, arguing that the competition between the two powers will turn on how “effectively each country stewards its national economy and shapes the global economy.”At the same time, Beijing has vowed to continue easing barriers to its capital markets. Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking &amp; Insurance Regulator Commission, wrote in a recent article that the fortunes of a nation are “often closely tied to its financial power” and that it will seek to actively participate in shaping international rules.The opening isn’t some act to “reconcile” with the U.S. to defuse tensions but driven by self interest, said Jessie Guo, head of equity research at China Merchants Securities HK Co. The nation will keep the doors open as it pivots toward a “dual circulation” strategy in which the domestic market becomes the main growth driver, supplemented by foreign demand, she said.The push has so far paid off for China in a tumultuous year, when its economy outperformed major rivals after the nation successfully contained the coronavirus.A September survey by HSBC Qianhai Securities showed that almost two-thirds of more than 900 global institutional investors and major corporations are planning to increase their investment in China by an average of 25% over the next year. Investors in North America stood out as the only ones saying they will hold off on increasing their exposure to mainland Chinese corporate bonds and commercial paper.Approvals to take major control in China have continued for foreign banks, asset managers and payment clearing networks. Firms including Goldman and Credit Suisse Group AG have ambitious hiring plans in China, and argue they can boost investments in the country since they are better able to control where the money is being put to use. Analysts at Goldman at the end of last year estimated profits in the Chinese brokerage sector could reach $47 billion by 2026, up from $10 billion in 2018.Regulators have also given overseas traders access to futures and options, expanded a U.S.-style registration system for IPOs and scrapped quotas on foreign inflows.That’s being noticed in the halls of Washington. A Congressional commission this week warned that China’s financial opening was part of a “calculated strategy” to secure foreign investments and use them to shore up the domestic economy.U.S. lawmakers this week approved legislation that could lead to Chinese companies getting delisted unless they allow a review of their financial audits, albeit with a three-year phase-in period. Sanctions on Chinese firms connected to the military triggered JPMorgan to exclude new bonds from impacted companies from its widely followed debt indexes, underscoring how the U.S. can affect index-tracking investors around the world.Banks also face a deadline this month for ensuring that they aren’t doing business with Hong Kong and Chinese officials sanctioned over their role in the political crackdown on the financial hub. Lenders, including major Chinese banks, have already taken steps to comply.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:Decoupling from the U.S. could create a windfall for China’s financial sector as it swoops in for a bigger slice of the global IPO market, drawing overseas investors to its derivatives trading and adding new vigor to the world’s fastest-growing pool of wealth. Yet, worsening relations with the U.S. could spook foreign companies enough for them to consider postponing expansion, cutting investment, or leaving China altogether. Read more hereBanks and asset managers have to do more due diligence to avoid the risks of servicing sanctioned Chinese firms such as helping them to list or to raise capital, according to Benjamin Quinlan, chief executive officer at Quinlan &amp; Associates, a strategy consultant in Hong Kong.“That means having much stricter ‘know your customer’ and onboarding controls,” he said. “The reality is the biggest fines in the world are for sanction breaches with the U.S.”China’s response so far has been to continue down the path of further opening, though the toughest reforms are yet to come. China’s strategy to make the yuan a global currency has so far come up short, with its share in payments falling to 1.66% as of October from 1.94% at the end of last year.Capital controls and the uncertainty of repatriating funds remain a key hurdle for global investors as do a lack of transparency in rule-making. The abrupt cancellation of Ant Group’s record IPO in early November sent shudders through the markets.That hasn’t swayed global firms such as Goldman Sachs. President John Waldron said in October that the U.S. bank is still waiting on further guidance on how to apply for a 100% stake. He also proposed further liberalization measures including reduced constraints on outbound capital flows, allowing foreign firms to act as market makers in China’s bond connect and further alignment with international regulatory standards.Henry Fernandez, chairman of MSCI Inc., said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview that the opening shows China “is recognizing that in order to have that leadership in the world, economically, politically and financially, they need to embrace openness and become one of the largest countries in the world in all these markets.”With the incoming Biden administration, “hopefully we can avoid a capital war, which can be devastating,” Fernandez said.Here’s a scorecard on the financial opening:SecuritiesAsset ManagementFuturesPayments(Adds details on Goldman in third parapraph from end.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2020 Bloomberg L.P.</p> <span> My Portfolio &amp; Markets</span> <span> Customize</span> Recently Viewed <span> <span> Your list is empty.</span> </span> <span> <span> My Watchlist</span> </span> <span> Sign-in to view your list and add symbols.</span> Sign In Cryptocurrencies <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> Currencies <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> Trending Tickers <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> Stocks: Most Actives <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> Stocks: Gainers <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> Stocks: Losers <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> Top Mutual Funds <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> Futures <span> Symbol</span> <span> Last Price</span> <span> Change</span> <span> % Change</span> <span> <span> © 2020 Verizon Media.
